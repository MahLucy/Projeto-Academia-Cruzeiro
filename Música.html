  <p>Why wait to say? At least I did it my way<br>
Lie awake, two faced<br>
But in my heart I understand<br>
I made my move and it was all about you<br>
Now I feel so far removed</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way</p>

<p>My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way</p>

<p>My way<br>
My way<br>
My way</p>

<p>Why wait to say? At least I did it my way<br>
Lie awake, two faced<br>
But in my heart I understand<br>
I made my move and it was all about you<br>
Now I feel so far removed</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way</p>

<p>My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way<br>
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way</p>

<p>My way</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way</p>

<p>You were the one thing in my way<br>
You were the one thing in my way<br>

  <p>I got this feeling inside my bones<br>
It goes electric, wavy, when I turn it on<br>
And if you want inside your soul<br>
Just open up your heart, let music take control</p>

<p>I got that sunshine in my pocket<br>
Got that good song in my feet<br>
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops<br>
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally<br>
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop</p>

<p>Under the lights when everything goes<br>
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close<br>
When we move, well, you already know<br>
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine</p>

<p>Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance<br>
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you<br>
So just dance, dance, dance, come on<br>
All those things I should do to you<br>
But you dance, dance, dance<br>
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing</p>

<p>I can't stop the feeling<br>
So just dance, dance, dance<br>
I can't stop the feeling<br>
So just dance, dance, dance, come on</p>

<p>Ooh, it's something magical<br>
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on<br>
I don't need no reason, don't need control<br>
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone</p>

<p>'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket<br>
Got that good song in my feet<br>
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops<br>
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally<br>
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop</p>

<p>Under the lights when everything goes<br>
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close<br>
When we move, well, you already know<br>
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine</p>

<p>Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance<br>
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you<br>
So just dance, dance, dance, come on<br>
All those things I should do to you<br>
But you dance, dance, dance<br>
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing</p>

<p>I can't stop the feeling<br>
So just dance, dance, dance<br>
I can't stop the feeling<br>
So just dance, dance, dance</p>

<p>I can't stop the feeling<br>
So just dance, dance, dance<br>
I can't stop the feeling<br>
So keep dancing, come on</p>

<p>I can't stop the, I can't stop the<br>
I can't stop the, I can't stop the<br>
I can't stop the feeling</p>

<p>Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance<br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you<br>
So just dance, dance, dance, come on<br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
All those things I should do to you<br>
But you dance, dance, dance<br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing</p>

<p>(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
Everybody sing<br>
Got this feeling in my body<br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
Got this feeling in my body<br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
Wanna see you move your body<br><br>
(I can't stop the feeling)<br>
Got this feeling in my body</p>

<p>Break it down<br>
Got this feeling in my body<br>
I can't stop the feeling<br>
Got this feeling in my body<br>
I can't stop the feeling<br>
Got this feeling in my body, come on</p>

  <p>First things first<br>
I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
I'm fired up and tired of the way<br>
That things have been, oh-ooh<br>
The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
Second things second<br>
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br></p>

<p> was broken from a young age<br>
Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
Writing my poems for the few<br>
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
Taking my message from the veins<br>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
Seeing the beauty through the<br></p>

<p>Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>

<p>First things first<br>
Can you imagine what's about to happen?<br>
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons<br>
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for Imaginin'<br>
This is what's happenin'<br>
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate<br>
Sound about accurate<br>
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy<br>
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities<br>
I know the passages just come with some traffic<br>
I start from the basement, end up in the attic<br>
And third thing third<br>
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count<br>
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this- huh<br>
Is you a believer?<br>
I get a unicorn out of a zebra<br>
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo<br>
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather<br>
Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader<br>
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain<br>
I know the losin' don't come without shame<br>
I know the beauty don't come without a hurt<br>
Hold up, hold up, last thing last<br>
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne<br>
I know that losin' don't come without game<br>
I know that beauty don't come without<br>
Don't come without
(Pain)</p>

<p>Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>

<p>Last things last<br>
By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
You're the face of the future<br>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
Inhibited, limited<br>
Till it broke open and rained down<br>
And rained down, like</p>

<p>Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br>
Pain!<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
Pain!<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
